> "Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out" - Robert Collier

I just googled "importance of consistency" to write a cool quote for my blog. 
If you have noticed, I am still trying to catch up with my blog assignment! (I am currently finishing up my CLI project)


## Mix ups
Even though I am not expert in any of the computer languages yet, I've studied basic languages of the following:
* java
* javascript
* python
* MATLAB
* HTML/CSS
* R
* Ruby

Ruby is the LAST language I've learned, and at first I kept mixing up syntaxes between languages. 


If you have read my previous blog, I've lived in Iraq for 6 years. During those time, I've learned Kurdish (intermediate), Arabic (Few words and phrases), and Assyrian (few words and phrases). When I am teaching, I've noticed that sometimes some words come out in Korean and sometimes Kurdish and all mixed up!

I guess at first Ruby was like that for me. At first I would try to use python syntax and how I would program in python since python at the time was my strongest programming language, but I realized the more I use Ruby everyday, I slowly became more familar with "Ruby style". 

So I think the most important thing about learning or getting back to ANY programming language is **consistency**.
