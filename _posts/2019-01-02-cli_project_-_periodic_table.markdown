I am a full time high school science teacher. I teach biology, chemistry, physics, and anatomy physiology - yeah, it can get a bit exhausting preparing for all those lessons, but I shouldn't be complaining!


Finding a topic was a tough! I didn't know what to do! So here were some ideas I wanted to do before my final choice:

1. Headlines from major news network.
- So I thought I wanted to make CLI project that can scrape from major news network website just the headlines so that the user can just see headlines of the day! If the user finds an interesting headline, they could see the detail and eventually able to open up the website. But this idea "failed" because I had a hard time scraping CNN and other major news websites!

2. Best computer builds
- I used to play PC games a lot especially my high school - college years. Even though I would love to build a PC right now, I can't really afford it (gg life). Anyway, so for my future reference, I thought about scraping from computer part website, "best builds" that users have voted. So basically, this would scrape top-voted builds from the website along with parts + cost, and the user can choose which build they want to check out. They could potentially see what parts, brand, price, reviews within the build. BUT once again, the scraping part was very tricky , so I gave up while scraping second level.


So I was thinking, how about I do something related to science? So I have decided to scrape data about elements from wikipedia. 

I wanted my program to do the following:
* List all the elements with basic information
* Search an element using atomic number, name, or symbol
* Search elements by their group number or just name an element and list all the elements that are in the same group
* Search elements by their period number or just name and element and list all the lements that are in the same period
* Able to read detailed properties and description of each element when user chooses to

And that's what I am doing!
