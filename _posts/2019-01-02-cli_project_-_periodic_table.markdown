I am a full time high school science teacher. I teach biology, chemistry, physics, and anatomy physiology - yeah, it can get a bit exhausting preparing for all those lessons, but I shouldn't be complaining!


## My unSUCCESSFUL ideas
Finding a topic was a tough! I didn't know what to do! So here were some ideas I wanted to do before my final choice:

1. Headlines from major news network.
- So I thought I wanted to make CLI project that can scrape from major news network website just the headlines so that the user can just see headlines of the day! If the user finds an interesting headline, they could see the detail and eventually able to open up the website. But this idea "failed" because I had a hard time scraping CNN and other major news websites!

2. Best computer builds
- I used to play PC games a lot especially my high school - college years. Even though I would love to build a PC right now, I can't really afford it (gg life). Anyway, so for my future reference, I thought about scraping from computer part website, "best builds" that users have voted. So basically, this would scrape top-voted builds from the website along with parts + cost, and the user can choose which build they want to check out. They could potentially see what parts, brand, price, reviews within the build. BUT once again, the scraping part was very tricky , so I gave up while scraping second level.


## My EUREKA! moment
So I was thinking, how about I do something related to science? So I have decided to scrape data about elements from wikipedia. 

I wanted my program to do the following:
* List all the elements with basic information
* Search an element using atomic number, name, or symbol
* Search elements by their group number or just name an element and list all the elements that are in the same group
* Search elements by their period number or just name and element and list all the lements that are in the same period
* Able to read detailed properties and description of each element when user chooses to

And that's what I am doing!

## Scraping
Scraping wikipedia was pretty simple both 1st and 2nd level. Even though there were irregularities in the 2nd level, it wasn't something I couldn't handle.

Thank you **Nokogiri**!

## CLI CLI CLI CLI....
I think I've spent most of my time trying to think about how to optimize userability of the program. I kept going through my program asking myself "is this convenient?", "does this work flow make sense?", "what is a better way to show the data", "what could I add or change or take out?". So I kept changing and modifying the codes so that the program **makes sense** at least for me (ha!)

## git commit -m "OOPS I FORGOT TO COMMIT": my commitment issue
So yeah, I have a commitment issue. Not with people but with git! I totally forgot to commit every few minutes after adding few lines of code with concise descriptions (just like me forgetting to write blog posts regularly - see any pattern?). So after making most of structures of the program, I've finally made my first commit on github... 

**git commit -m "I will be better"**
**git push**

## Refactoring
After getting all the functionality working as I hoped, I've started refactoring! **OH BOOYYYYYY**, so much! 

I usually turned in my rough drafts as my final draft back in high school and college, and now I've realized I've been submitting **!@#$**. I should probably apologize all my teachers and professors for making them painfully read my "final" drafts.

Anyways, I've been making my program more concise by combining "repeated" codes, and also I've made comments so others could follow the logic as well. 

On top of it, I've been making commitments whenever I remember! (improvement)

I will post link to git repository once I am done.


Thanks for reading if you've made it all the way here.
