So it turns out I was supposed to write blog posts while doing online course. So here I am to write about how I ended up joining Flatiron School.

### *Before Flatiron School*
I graduated from Vanderbilt University with Biomeidcal engineering degree in 2010. I wanted to go to medical school, but it didn't really work out in the first year, so I ended up getting tutoring job in Nashville while getting heavily involved in local church and international missionary organization. After serving in the missionary organization, I've decided to go to Iraq through a NGO group. Even though I was only supposed to be there for two years, I fell in love with the people in Iraq-Kurdistan that I ended up staying there for 6 years (2012-2018).

People asked me what it was like in Iraq because most of the images they have about Iraq is terrorism and unending violence. Indeed, there are many parts of Iraq that suffer from these things, but the region I was living in was the northern part also known as "Kurdistan". It has semi-autonomous government, and the region is relatively safe compared to other regions of Iraq. So for me, living in Iraq-Kurdistan was just amazing! Food was so good that I've gained over 20 pounds (people love to invite others all the time), culture was unique and quite similar to Korean culture, and the people were so friendly. 

So basically, I was there doing a lot of different things including:
* ESL classes for refugees
* Food/medical distribution to refugees and IDPs
* TaeKwonDo master (for beginners)
* Elementary/middle/high school math teacher at British international school
* Middle/high school math and science teacher at American international school

It was really tough to come back to States because I've made many bonds with people especially my students. I came back in July, 2018. 

### Why coding?
So after I got back, I pressured myself to get a decent job, but it was really tough. I've tried to study little bit of python before coming back to get an entry level or internship (my brother is a data scientist), but it miserably failed. One day I came across "flatiron" ad on facebook, and I started working on the prep work. Even though HTML/CSS part was a bit drag for me, once I got into JS and Ruby, it got really fun. 

I've always loved problem solving (that's why I got an engineering degree). I only got to use basical Java back in high school and MATLAB in college, but I just loved making little programs that solve specific problems. 

The reason why I chose "web developement" over "data science" is that it seemed like "web developement" could use not only my "problem solving" skills but my creactivity as well. 

I am very excited to continue and finish my online self-paced web developement program!
